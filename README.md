### Servus, welcome to my profile!

- I am an aspiring front-end developer and digital artist
- I love working on personal projects but often lack the time and cash (my go-to excuse for being lazy)
- I am currently learning CSS, JS and C#
- Besides coding I do graphic design, I like making prototype websites and apps in Figma
- I also have a thing for modern architecture (I used to be a huge The Sims fan as a kid)
