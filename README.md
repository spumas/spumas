### ✈ Servus, welcome to my profile!

- 🖼️ I am an aspiring front-end developer and digital artist
- ❤️ I love working on personal projects whenever I find time for them
- 🔥 I am currently learning CSS, JS and C#
- 🖊️ Besides coding I do graphic design, I like making prototype websites and apps in Figma
- 🏚️ I also have a thing for modern architecture (I used to be a huge The Sims fan as a kid)

My main project is called the Venture Group©, that's what I am building while I learn CSS and JS to become proficient in web development so I can soon start using JS frameworks. I haven't really started yet, as I am mainly busy with the Odin Project (I have some repos up regarding that one accordingly)
