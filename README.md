### ✈ Servus, welcome to my profile!

- 🖼️ I am an aspiring front-end developer and digital artist
- ❤️ I love working on personal projects but often lack the time and cash (my go-to excuse for being lazy)
- 🔥 I am currently learning CSS, JS and C#
- 🖊️ Besides coding I do graphic design, I like making prototype websites and apps in Figma
- 🏚️ I also have a thing for modern architecture (I used to be a huge The Sims fan as a kid)

- - - - - My main project is called the Venture Group©, that's what I am building while I learn CSS and JS to become proficient in web development so I can soon start using JS frameworks.
